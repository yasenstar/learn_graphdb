## TBox and ABox

Original: "A Translation Approach to Portable Ontology Specification", by Thomas R. Gruber, 1993, Appeared in Knowledge Acquisition

- A __TBox__ is a set of "schema" axioms (sentences)
- A __ABox__ is a set of "data" axioms (ground facts)
- A Knowledge Base (KB) is just a TBox plus a ABox

Why discuss their separateness?

- In a traditional system, they are separate (DDL v. DML)
- But inseparable
- In semantics (语义) they are more similar than different (it's all triples)
- And they are separable
- You can apply a different world view (TBox) on the same ground facts (ABox), e.g. multiple TBoxes for one ABox
