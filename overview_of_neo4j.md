# Neo4j is a Graph Database

## What is a Graph?

A __graph__ is set of discrete objects, each of which has some set of relationships with the other objects.

## Neo4j's property graph

The components of a Neo4j graph include:

- Nodes = Vertex
- Relationships = Edge
- Labels
- Properties

### Nodes

- Represent objects or entities
- Can be labeled

There're 2 kinds of data that can be associated a node: labels and properties

### Nodes Properties

- Represent objects or entities
- Can be labeled
- May have properties

Properties are used to associate specific information with individual nodes.

### Relationships

- Must have a type
- Must have a direction

### Relationship Properties

- Must have a type
- Must have a direction
- May have properties

### Multiple Relationships

- Must have a type
- Mut have a direction
- May have properties
- Nodes can share multiple relationships
